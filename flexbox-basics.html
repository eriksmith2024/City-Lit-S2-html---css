    <h1>Flexible Box Model </h1>
    
    <p> When the browser starts to 
        render a web page it will read through the 
        html elements and create them in the same 
        order as they appear in the code.</p>

    <p> This is called the flow and the browser will stack each 
        element vertically in the same order as the code</p>

    <h2> Default flow</h2>

    <section> First element</section>
    <section> Second element </section>

    <h2> Flexbox Layout</h2>

    <p> One way of rearranging our boxes is 
        to put them in to flex box mode which 
        allows us to flow our boxes in different 
        ways.</p>

    <p> In order to use flexible box Model we need a 
        container and at least two child elements</p>

    <div class="wrapper"> 
        <section>Item One</section>
        <section>Item Two</section>
    </div>

    <p> As soon as we change the wrapper / container to 
        display flex any items within will move into a 
        horizontal row.</p>
