    <h1> Structural Tags in HTML </h1>

    <p> To allow us to create areas in our page to contain content that are semantic, we got some new tags in HTML 5</p>

    <h2> The Header Element</h2>

    <p> We can use this to define the header element of our page</p>

    <p> it might include content such as the site title, possibly the navigation bar, tagline, logos, branding, 
        search account icon / avatar, shopping cart</p>

    <h2> The Nav Element</h2>

    <p> We can use this to contain any significant menu of links. The nav element can appear on ts own or nested within
        other elements
    </p>

    <h2> The Main Element</h2>

    <p> Use this to define the main content area. It should only include content that is unique to this page.</p>

    <h2>The Section Element</h2>

    <p> Use this to define an area of content or the start of a new topic - used for discrete areas</p>

    <h2> The Article Element</h2>

    <p>Use this to define an area of content that would still make sense if we took it out of the page and put it somewhere else.</p>

    <h2> The Footer Element</h2>
    
    <p> This should contain information at the end of the page. It may contain copyright information, contact details, 
        physical address, social networks links, additional nav i.e. map, t&cs, mail sign ups, secondary navigation </p>
