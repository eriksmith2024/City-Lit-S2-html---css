    <h1> Mixing Selectors in CSS</h1>

    <p>There are many different ways we can mix two or more selectors in CSS.</p>

    <P> Somtimes we ant to make a selector more efficient and other times we want to 
        make one more specific or conditional</P>

    <h2> Types of Mixed Selector</h2>

    <h3> Combined Selector</h3>

    <p> The combined selector is a comma seperated list of selectors which we can 
        use to make our css more efficient</p>

    <h3>Descendant Selector</h3>

    <p>Descend selectors are used to target child, grandchild or other elements that 
        are descended from a parent</p>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Child Element</h3>
        <p>Child Paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <p> Descenedant selectors are good for setting conditional styles</p>
