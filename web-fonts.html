    <h1>Web Fonts</h1>

    <p>In the bad old days it was difficult for graphic designers 
        to cope with making webpages because they couldn't use 
        all the fonts that they wanted to </p>

    <p> Eventually the problem was solved with web fonts which 
        are online libraries where we can load web fints from 
        without giving them away to users</p>
